            <p> José Ignacio Rasso, a 43-year-old, had the  flu; his muscles hurt, he had a fever and sweat overnight. He went to the doctor who gave him medicine for his lungs. The symptoms, however, persisted and he decided to get tested to find out if he had been infected with the novel Coronavirus. </p>

            <p> Rasso recalls the doctor asking him questions in rush, barely paying much attention due to the number of people waiting for their appointments. But the doctor’s face completely changed when Rasso told him he just came back from Spain, where he stayed for five days. At the time, Spain had 267 confirmed Covid-19 cases. A few days later, after calling several times he was informed his test came back positive, making him one of the 25 people who had been infected in Mexico. </p>

            <p>The first Covid-19 case was registered in Mexico on February 28— a 35-year-old man who, like Rasso, had just returned from Europe. At first, Mexico's secretary of health treated the pandemic as an external issue. Hospitals were only testing people who had returned from Europe or China. But on March 23, things changed.  A patient believed to have severe pneumonia tested positive, even though he hadn’t traveled nor had been in contact with someone who has. The virus was transmitted locally. </p> 

            <p> On March 24, Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced the beginning of Phase 2 of the pandemic—all non-essential businesses had to shut down and people were strongly encouraged to stay home. By then, Mexico had 930 confirmed cases, according to data from the General Department of Epidemiology. </p>

            <p> On April 21,  that number reached  14,658 confirmed cases. Health Undersecretary Hugo Lopez Gatell declared that same day the beginning of Phase 3, which is when the highest peak of contagiousness was expected to come. According to his estimation, this was going to happen on May 8. But his statement changed shortly after. “Estimations keep changing”, he said in a press conference.</p>

            <p> The scenario is similar for cases per 100 people: Three out of 10 municipalities with the highest number of cases per 100 people are in Mexico City or the State of Mexico. </p>

           <p> In the last five weeks, between April 12 and May 5, Covid-19 cases have reached other states, far from the center. Even though most cases have predominantly appeared in northern and southern states, in addition to the outbreak in the center, by then new cases have slowly started appearing in municipalities all around the country. </p>

          <p> Active cases are the number of people who have tested positive and have had symptoms for the past 14 days. In this map, cases range between April 22 and May 5. During this period, there were 6,708 cases all over the country. Active cases are in nine states and 13 municipalities, with Tamaulipas, Ciudad de Mexico, and Chiapas with the highest numbers. </p>

            <p> This investigation is part of the final project for the class J220 Intro to Coding.  Yuriria Avila built the code for this website, supervised by Jeremy Rue. </p>

            <p> Data used for this investigation is from the daily database published by the Mexican Institute of Epidemiology from February 28 until May 5, the day this work was submitted. Yuriria Avila analyzed the data using SQL. </p>

            <p> Yuriria built the interactive maps using the Data Wrapper tool. She also created the animations showing the progression of coronavirus positive cases, creating individual maps with Datawrapper and putting them together with Photoshop. An animation showing the increase in deaths resulted from Coronavirus wasn’t displayed because some people might find it triggering or upsetting. </p> 

            <p> Yuriria also performed the interviews. </p>
